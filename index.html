<p>This page is just to have a place where I can publish what is going on with the reading group, without touching the other repo.</p>

<p>The idea:
We want to participate in pull request review, but we don't really understand the codebase well enough. Rather than bother the devs doing the heavy lifting with "what does RandomFooStructure do???" I'd rather hash that kind of exploration elsewhere. That place is here.</p>

<p><em>Learn the codebase here, and pitch in back there if and when we can.</em></p>

<p>Each week every participant that is willing picks and analyzes open pull request(s) they find interesting from here: </p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls
</code></pre>

<p>People can then fork that specific branch on their own git repo:</p>

<pre><code>git clone -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;remote_repo&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then send a pull request to here:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/BitcoinPRReadingGroup/bitcoin
</code></pre>

<p>That way we will have a number of pull requests open, and can have open discussion on the pull request itself, without bothering the people actually doing the hard work. In-line comments are typically where the magic will happen, I'm guessing, but perhaps elsewhere as well. Pull requests and questions on those can range all the way from stupid trivial, to advanced changes with many subtleties. The whole point is to educate ourselves without bothering the big boys, so ask away. Converse, debate, annotate the code for clarity, whatever helps! </p>

<p>Lastly, if we come to a conclusion about a PR that would be helpful to the actual discussion in the mainline Bitcoin Core repo, the owner or others can simply do so at their leisure. </p>

<a id="week-1" class="anchor" href="#week-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 1</h3>

<p>For the trial run, let's just mix it up, and try a free-for-all type format. Just pick a single pull request, share it with the group on the repo, and start commenting. This 'week' will run from 18th of April until the end of the 25th, EST timezone. From that point on, open pull requests will be closed(unless interesting discussion is happening still?), and the repo will be updated to the latest master copy from mainline Bitcoin Core.</p>

<p>I'll also post an open/close thread on /r/bitcoinserious, just to make the project more visible and remind everyone to find a new PR to look at each week.</p>
